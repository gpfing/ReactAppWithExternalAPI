# API Keys Configuration

To use the Fixer.io API with this application, you need to get a free API key:

1. Visit https://fixer.io/
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Get your API key
4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory
5. Add your API key:

```
VITE_FIXER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Alternative (No API Key Required)

The application will automatically use the free ExchangeRate-API if no Fixer API key is provided.
This API doesn't require authentication and works out of the box for development purposes.

## Environment Variables

- `VITE_FIXER_API_KEY`: Your Fixer.io API key (optional)

Note: Environment variables in Vite must be prefixed with `VITE_` to be exposed to the client.
